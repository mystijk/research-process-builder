description: Build validated web research processes through self-annealing loops. Takes a research goal, generates search steps, tests against sample companies, scores accuracy, and iterates until 90%+. Use when creating new research workflows, building claygent/agent prompts, or systematizing any web research task.

# Research Process Builder

Factory that produces validated, step-by-step web research processes through iterative testing. Takes any research goal, generates search patterns, tests against real companies, scores accuracy, and loops until 90%+ reliability.

Output: portable `.md` process files any agent (Claude Code, Clay, custom GPT, browser agent) can follow.

## When To Use

- Building a new research workflow for any topic (company intel, market sizing, hiring signals, tech stack detection)
- Creating claygent or web research agent prompts that need to work reliably
- Systematizing any manual web research you do repeatedly

## When NOT To Use

- Running an existing research process (load the process `.md` directly)
- One-off research where you just need the answer
- Data enrichment at scale (use a dedicated enrichment tool)
