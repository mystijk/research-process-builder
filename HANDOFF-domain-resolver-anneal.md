# Handoff: Domain Resolver Annealing

**Status:** Foundation shipped, ready for annealing
**Date:** 2026-04-26
**Budget:** $8 (API costs: Serper $0.0075/search, GPT-4o-mini $0.002/call, Spider $0.001/scrape)
**Goal:** Push domain resolution accuracy from 97% to 99%+ on expanding ground truth

## What Exists

### New module: `scripts/domain_resolver.py`
- 3-tier waterfall: article regex → GPT extract → Serper search
- `validate_domain()` gate with 70+ blocked domains across 6 categories
- `resolve_domain_agent()` — GPT agent with tool-calling (higher accuracy, ~$0.02/call)
- `fuzzy_dedup_companies()` — token-overlap + Levenshtein + domain-based merge
- Score threshold (≥3) prevents low-confidence domains from leaking

### Wired into pipeline
- `pipeline_base.py` — validation gate on GPT-extracted domains, waterfall fallback, post-enrichment dedup
- `series_a_pipeline.py` — fuzzy dedup in Stage 2, hardened extraction prompt, Supabase field fix

### Test infrastructure
- `eval_pipeline.py` — 39 test cases, 97% accuracy, exits non-zero on regression
- `test_resolver_unit.py` — 27 unit tests for validate_domain, names_are_similar, fuzzy_dedup
- Backfill ground truth: 19 corrections (backfill-committed-20260425) + 16 agent tests (domain-agent-20260425)

### Production state
- 95 rows in Supabase `funding_discoveries`
- 17 bad domains fixed in latest backfill run (0 failures)
- 74 OK, 4 unchanged (correct name-mismatch), 0 blocked, 0 missing

## What Needs Annealing

### 1. Expand ground truth — DONE 2026-04-26 (smashed target)

**Shipped:**
- Harvested 95 rows from production Supabase `funding_discoveries` table.
- Filtered: encoding-issue rows, URL-format entries, names that look like article headers, www-prefixed domains normalized.
- Curated 70 new entries → KNOWN_GOOD_DOMAINS now 86 entries (was 16).
- All 86 pass validate_domain. Eval: 39/39 (100%) → 107/107 (100%).

**Skipped from harvest (worth manual review later):**
- "AI Startup" / "Newsroom" / similar generic-looking names
- Mosaic 3-way (kept mosaic.pe canonical, mosaicco.com + mosaic.ai are distinct companies)
- Strider Technologies vs Strider — kept as one entry

**Next pass:** harvest again every 2-3 weeks as Supabase grows.

### 2. Reduce not_found rate — DONE 2026-04-26 (root cause + verification)

**Root cause discovered:** OPENAI_API_KEY was None inside `domain_resolver` module. Tier 2 (GPT extract) and Tier 4 (agent fallback) both silently no-op'd, masquerading as "all tiers failed." Module loaded only repo-local dotenv + home dotenv, missed the workspace-root key store. Fixed in same commit.

**Verification on 2026-04-26 stage2 output:**

| Run | Resolved | not_found |
|---|---|---|
| Before fix | 1/9 (11%) | 8/9 |
| After fix | 8/9 (89%) | 1/9 |

The 1 remaining not_found ("Elizabeth Dorman & Megan Gole's Era") was actually a Stage 2 name extraction bug — should have extracted "Era". Fixed via `_clean_extracted_name` possessive-prefix rule.

**Bonus fixes from this run:**
- Agent fallback now logs every fire/result/error (was silently swallowing exceptions on `except Exception: break`)
- pipeline_base auto-discovers SHARED_SCRIPTS_PATH if not set
- "Sam Altman's Worldcoin" / "Founder's Company" possessive pattern handled

**Next pass:** monitor weekly catchup runs for new not_found cases, patch waterfall query templates as patterns emerge.

### 3. Tighten name extraction (Stage 2) — DONE 2026-04-26

**Shipped:**
- `FUNDING_VERBS` regex expanded — added `eyes`, `scores`, `pockets`, `wraps up`, `picks up`, `pulls in`, `hauls in`, `snags`, `grabs`, `locks in`, `banks`. Catches headlines like "Lumio eyes Series A" that previously got filtered.
- `_clean_extracted_name()` — strips article-style prefixes (`AI Startup`, `Fintech Startup`, `Identity Authentication Startup`, etc.). "Identity Authentication Startup Auth0 Raises…" → `Auth0`.
- `_is_bad_extraction()` — heuristic filter for column headers, post slugs, generic phrases. Catches: colons in name, `'s Post`, `'s Newsletter`, `Deal Closing`, `Fund Managers`, `Weekly News`, mostly-lowercase fragments.
- Fallback path also runs cleaning + bad-extraction filter.
- Bad rows now get filtered_out reason (`extracted name flagged as bad pattern`) instead of leaking to Stage 3 enrichment.
- `test_name_extraction.py` — 18 tests (all pass): verb expansion, prefix strip, bad-pattern reject.

**Validated against 2026-04-26 stage2:** 5 bad extractions identified pre-fix would now be filtered (TechCrunch Mobility column header, AI Market Watch's Post, Latest tech trends, Warehoused Deal Closing, Identity Authentication Startup Auth0 stripped to Auth0). 4 false-negatives ("Lumio eyes…", "GobbleCube snags…") would now extract correctly.

### 4. Cross-day dedup (Supabase level) — DONE 2026-04-26

**Shipped:**
- `match_existing_company()` in `domain_resolver.py` — domain-exact + fuzzy-name match (with www-prefix normalization)
- `fetch_recent_companies(days=30)` in `pipeline_base.py` — single GET to load recent rows once per push
- `push_to_supabase()` rewritten — PATCHes existing row (bumps source_count, max score, fills missing domain) instead of duplicate insert
- Within-batch + cross-day dedup combined in one Stage 4 pass
- 8 new unit tests in `test_resolver_unit.py` (all pass)
- Bonus: `names_are_similar` extended with prefix-token match — "Strider Tech" ↔ "Strider Technologies" now merges (min-len-4 guard prevents `ai`/`io` false positives)

**Verify on next live run:**
- Run pipeline on 3 consecutive days, confirm no duplicate company rows in DB
- Watch for `Cross-day merged: N` log line — proof it's firing
- Spot-check a merged row: source_count should reflect cumulative cross-day appearances

### 5. Block list expansion from production data — DONE 2026-04-26 (offline pass)

**Shipped:**
- Audited 7 backfill JSONs in `output/`. Found 7 candidate bad-domain patterns.
- Added to NEWS_DOMAINS: `ai-market-watch.com`, `oled-info.com` (industry newsletters/aggregators)
- New `LEGAL_SERVICES_DOMAINS` category added (law firms appearing in funding press as advisors): `gunder.com`, `wsgr.com`, `cooley.com`, `fenwick.com`, `lw.com`, `sidley.com`, `orrick.com`, `dlapiper.com`, `morganlewis.com`, `skadden.com`, `kirkland.com`, `morrisonforester.com`, `mofo.com`. Pre-loaded common funding-counsel domains beyond what backfill surfaced.
- `anu.edu.au` already caught by EDU_PATTERN — no change needed.
- 4 new test cases in `test_resolver_unit.py` (all pass).

**Eval impact: 38/39 (97%) → 39/39 (100%).** gunder.com was the failing case.

**Next pass:** re-run audit weekly against new backfill JSONs, append new bad domains.

### 6. Prompt annealing for GPT extraction
The extraction prompt in `series_a_pipeline.py:get_extraction_prompt()` can be formally annealed using the anneal loop system.

**Anneal approach:**
- Build test cases: 20 articles with known-correct extraction (company, domain, amount, investors)
- Run through `/anneal-prompt` targeting gpt-4o-mini
- Graduate when 95%+ accuracy
- Replace current prompt with graduated version

**Budget:** ~$2.50 (anneal loop runs ~10 iterations × ~$0.25 each)

## Commands

```bash
# Set env
$env:SHARED_SCRIPTS_PATH = "C:\Users\mitch\Everything_CC\leadgrow-hq\tools\shared-scripts"

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `scripts/domain_resolver.py` | Unified domain resolution module (THE source of truth) |
| `scripts/pipeline_base.py` | Base pipeline class (Stage 3 enrichment, Stage 4 output) |
| `scripts/series_a_pipeline.py` | Series A subclass (queries, filters, extraction prompt) |
| `scripts/eval_pipeline.py` | Eval harness (must pass before any change ships) |
| `scripts/test_resolver_unit.py` | Unit tests |
| `scripts/backfill_domains.py` | Supabase domain backfill agent |
| `output/backfill-committed-*.json` | Backfill change logs (ground truth source) |
| `output/domain-agent-*.json` | Agent test results (ground truth source) |

## Rules

1. Run `py eval_pipeline.py --offline` after EVERY change. Must stay ≥ 97%.
2. Run `py test_resolver_unit.py` after any change to domain_resolver.py.
3. Never remove a domain from BLOCKED_DOMAINS without evidence it caused a false positive.
4. Add new ground truth cases for every failure you fix.
5. Commit after each successful annealing iteration with clear message.
